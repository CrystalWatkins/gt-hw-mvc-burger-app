# node-express-burger-app

## Description 

This is a homework requirement for GT Full Stack Flex Program. This node express burger app and webpage is designed to utilize server side rendering using MVC. By using handlebars we were asked to create a directory structure for this homework which was followed exactly as asked. When you open the website, you are able to see burgers pop up. You can then add a burger that you want to eat. It will then put it in the "Burgers To Be Eaten" column, where you can choose to "eat" the burger with the touch of a button and then it will move to the "devoured" column. From there, you can say you are still hungry and it will move the burger back to the "Burgers To Be Eaten" column!
